### Keeping Drupal relevant 
#### in a world of Jamstack and CMS-as-a-service

---

### About me

@larowlan

Note:

- Web development for over 20 years
- Core framework member, security team
- I came to Drupal from ancient JavaScript frameworks like YUI

---

### Ô∏èOverview

Note:

- Brief jamstack overview
- Examine Headless CMS offerings, including SAAS
- What role can Drupal play

---

### First some truths

Note:

- Let's start with some concepts we hold true

---

### Javascript is eating the web

Note:

- But JS is the lingua franca of the web
- PHP still pays well

---

### Developers don't want to work in Twig

Note:

- FE developers want to use their framework of choice

---

### Content editors have requirements

Note:

- We can't throw the baby out with the bathwater
- Frameworks like Drupal have put a lot of power in the hands of content-editors
- We can't just take that away
- I want to pause on this because we will come back to this

### Jamstack

https://jamstack.org

Note:

- This is a decoupled conf, I'm talking to the converted
- Javascript APIs and Markup
- Pages are rendered at build time
- Deployed to a CDN
- Dynamic functionality added via JS and APIs

---

### Hard problems

Note:

- it's not all rainbows
- build times
- cache invalidation
- lack of context
- big sites are challenging (github issues my build takes 8hrs)

---

### Headless CMS landscape

https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/

Note:

- The landscape is crowded, 71 API based 
- 32 open source, the rest are SAAS

---

### Strapi

* open source w/ SAAS version
* no features above what Drupal can do
* very nice content editor/site builder experience

Note:

- open source w/ enterprise edition
- very similar (smaller) feature set to Drupal with a slick UI
- plugins installed with yarn, which triggers a full rebuild
- graphql, defaults to v3 style, but you can customise it
